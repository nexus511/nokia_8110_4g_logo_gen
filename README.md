# Splash converter for Nokia 8110 4G

This repository contains the logo_gen.py from Codeaurora containing a patch
that allows using it for the Nokia 8110 4G. The splash.img for the Nokia
8110 4G uses a 16 bit instead of a 24 bit colorspace, so the 8 bytes per
color need to be condensed to 5 bits for red and blue and 6 bits for green.
